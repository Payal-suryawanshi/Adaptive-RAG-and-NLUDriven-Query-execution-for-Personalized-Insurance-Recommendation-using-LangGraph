Some benefits are guaranteed and some benefits are variable with returns based on the future performance of your insurer carrying on life insurance business. If your policy offers guaranteed benefits then these will be clearly marked “guaranteed” in the illustration table on this page. If your policy offers variable benefits then the illustrations on this page will show two different rates of assumed future investment returns, of 8% p.a. and 4% p.a. These assumed rates of return are not guaranteed and they are not the upper or lower limits of what you might get back, as the value of your policy is dependent on a number of factors including future investment performance.”\\n\\n**Source PDF:** LIC_Jeevan Umang_Sales Brochure_4 inch x 9 inch_Eng (4).pdf  \\n**Policy Name:** LIC Jeevan Umang Sales Brochure 4 inch x 9 inch Eng (4)  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Output Objective:** Summarize accurately and concisely for each item, preserving important data and ensuring clarity and consistency in formatting.',\n"," '---\\n\\n**Content Type:** Table  \\n**Summary:** The table provides details on the policy options and premium summary for the LIC Jeevan Umang policy.
